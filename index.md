In this Python concurrency tutorial, we will write a small Python script to download images from [Imgur](https://imgur.com). Imgur is
a popular image sharing site.

We will start with a version that downloads images sequentially, or one at a time, and then explore techniques for improving the performance of the
program by introducing different forms of concurrency.

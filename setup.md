The first thing will need is an account on [Imgur](https://imgur.com) if you don't already have one. Go to the web site and select the **`sign up`** link.
Follow the the instructions to register.

Once you have created an account, you will need to register [an application on Imgur](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient). First, enter a name
for the application, which can be anything, but probably needs to be unique (e.g. containing your Net ID). Then select 
**`Anonymous usage without user authorization`** for the **`Authorization type`**. Next, enter `https://imgur.com` for the 
**`Authorization callback URL`**. Finally, enter an email addres and click on **`submit`**.

You should now see a new page containing a **`Client ID`**. You will need to copy this ID for use later.
